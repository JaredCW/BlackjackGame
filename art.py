# Set the logo for this game to the variable "logo", logo artwork comes from ascii.co.uk

# Using three quotation marks, """ """, this is a DOCSTRING, or Documentation String. Python docstrings are Strings used right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module
# Docstrings are different from comments, so while this looks like a block comment, it isn't best practice to use it for the purpose!
# For multiline comments, continue using the '#' on each line
